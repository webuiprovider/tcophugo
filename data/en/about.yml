      of the mine when Mr. Arnold H. Johnson purchased the property that included the Zellweger mine
      in 1932.


      During his life the astute geologist and devoted father progressed the development of the mine
      and ensured a steady supply of essential materials instrumental to the United States
      Government's welcomed support to the Allied forces in World War II before leaving his life's work
      in the trusted hands of his son John Johnson.


      In 2020 John Johnson and family welcomed a new partnership with Tempestas Capital, a
      respected Ethical Investment Fund with interests in renewable energies and green projects.
